Zayup.ai
​Autonomous Restaurant Vendor Automation
​Zayup.ai is a collaborative services-based repository developed between AHA and Zayup.ai. It serves as an intelligent orchestration layer designed to automate customer interactions and restaurant operations by bridging natural conversation with enterprise Point of Sale (POS) systems.
​🚀 The Solution
​Zayup.ai provides a seamless, "always-on" AI workforce that handles the most critical and repetitive tasks in the hospitality industry:
​Autonomous Voice & Text Ordering: Intelligent agents that process complex menu customizations and place orders directly into the POS.
​Customer Support Automation: Instant resolution for order tracking, store information, and location-specific inquiries.
​Multi-Vendor Orchestration: A robust middleware that synchronizes real-time data across various restaurant ecosystems.
​⚙️ Core Architecture: Proprietary Adapter Patterns
​The system is built on a modular Adapter Pattern architecture. This proprietary design allows Zayup.ai to integrate with industry-standard POS vendors through a unified interface, ensuring consistency regardless of the underlying hardware:
​FoodTec: Primary integration for high-volume delivery and franchise operations.
​Clover: Specialized adapters for small-to-medium business hardware and inventory sync.
​Square: Rapid deployment adapters for modern, cloud-first restaurant environments.
​🛠️ Key Capabilities
​Natural Language Understanding: Context-aware conversations across voice and future text/SMS channels.
​Stateless Reliability: Hosted on GCP with GCS-backed persistence to ensure the "digital hostess" remains accurate across server restarts.
​Infinite Scalability: Designed to manage thousands of concurrent calls without latency degradation.
​System Status
​Primary Protocol: Voice AI (Vapi + Cloud Backend)
​Infrastructure: Google Cloud Platform / Lovable Frontend / Supabase
​Vendor Support: FoodTec (Production), Clover (Beta), Square (Alpha)
